What did you learn?
1. You can use pop() instead of list slicing to reduce the size of the array.
2. instead of keeping the entire array, reduce the size and the calculation burden by using set(). 
3. Initialize  an array of size n by "array = [0] * n"
4. You don't have to rank the rankers, they are already in a order so all you have to do is sorted(list(set()))
5. Use while loop instead of for loops if you aren't clear when to stop.
