What did you learn?
1. Literally the hardest algorithm question I have ever solved.
2. If the problem is difficult, almost impossible to solve in one go, please divide the question's requirement into pieces. Or else, you will never be able to solve it.
3. First you must understand combinations. How can a wall of length of 8 be made? Obviously because there are only 4 types of blocks, it must be a combination of the 4. 
z[8] = z[7]+z[6]+z[5]+z[4]
4. Next you must calculate the number of solid walls starting from the index 1. Using DP seemed obvious, but not in this way to be honest.

Lets solve this question in the future once again.
